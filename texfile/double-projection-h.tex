\section{Introduction}
This header file provides a method to update the velocity and pressure gradient separately, mitigating error accumulation in the pressure gradient due to a non-strictly divergence-free cell-centered velocity. This approach requires an additional projection step.

As discussed in the documentation for \texttt{centered.h}, the cell-centered velocity $\mathbf{u}^n$ is not strictly divergence-free. This is because it is computed by interpolating the source term (comprising acceleration and pressure gradient), which complements the strictly divergence-free face-centered velocity. Consequently, when updating the pressure gradient $\nabla p$ in the next time step by solving the Poisson equation for $\mathbf{u}^{***}$, defined as

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}^{***} = \mathbf{u}^n - \Delta t \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u})^{n+1/2}
+ \frac{\Delta t}{\rho^{n+1/2}} \nabla \cdot \left( 2 \mu^{n+1/2}_f \mathbf{D}^{**} \right),
\end{equation}

the non-divergence-free error in $\mathbf{u}^n$ accumulates, as $\mathbf{u}^{***}$ includes $\mathbf{u}^n$. As reported on the \texttt{Basilisk} website, this issue can be significant under certain conditions.

\section{Solution Approach}
To address this issue, we exclude $\mathbf{u}^n$ from $\mathbf{u}^{***}$ as therotically it satisfies $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}^n = 0$. The pressure gradient $\nabla p$ is then computed by solving

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = \nabla \cdot \left[ -\Delta t \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u})^{n+1/2}
+ \frac{\Delta t}{\rho^{n+1/2}} \nabla \cdot \left( 2 \mu^{n+1/2}_f \mathbf{D}^n \right) \right].
\end{equation}

To maintain a divergence-free velocity field, an additional projection iteration is required. The velocity update process is now defined as follows:

\begin{gather}
\frac{\rho^{n+1/2}}{\Delta t} \left( \mathbf{u}^{**} - \mathbf{u}^n \right)
+ \rho^{n+1/2} \left[ \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u})^{n+1/2}
+ \frac{\nabla p^n}{\rho^{n-1/2}} \right]
= \nabla \cdot \left( 2 \mu^{n+1/2}_f \mathbf{D}^{n+1/2} \right), \label{eq:velocity_update} \\
\nabla^2 \delta p = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}^{**}, \quad \mathbf{u}^{n+1/2} = \mathbf{u}, \label{eq:poisson_delta_p} \\
\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \mathbf{u}^{**} - \frac{\Delta t}{\rho^{n+1/2}} \nabla \delta p^n, \label{eq update}
\end{gather}

where $\delta p$ is the temporary pressure gradient to correct the velocity field.
